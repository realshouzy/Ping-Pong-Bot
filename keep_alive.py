#Its a server to keep the bot online.
#Make a 2nd file and name it : keep_alive.py
#Then copy the code from here in that file:
#The code is from: https://gist.github.com/beaucarnes/51ec37412ab181a2e3fd320ee474b671
#After that go on uptimerobot and create a new monitor with the url the keep_alive.py file created.
#Then the bot will stay then online for ever.
